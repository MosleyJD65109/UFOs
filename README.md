The UFOs analysis is a web app that collects and displays the information surrounding the sightings of UFOs. The application allows the user to filter UFO sightings based on date, city, state, country and even the shape of the phenomenon.


## Results: 
 
California has an usually high amount of UFO sightings. The number of reported sightings comes in at 30. Half of these sightings have occured in San Diego County alone.
This web app allows for users to read and research about the project and its findings.

## Summary 
The UFO sighting search results are limited to the location of where they were seen. If someone searched a city where there were no sightings, the search results would return no listings. This makes sense, of course there are locations where UFOs have never been reported.
